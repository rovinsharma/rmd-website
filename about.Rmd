I am Rovin Sharma, a plant biology undergraduate student in University of Massachusetts.

I am part of the Caicedo lab, in my university, as a research assistant. I work with the many divergent species of tomatoes.
This website contains some of the R Data Visualization work I have done with data collected in my lab.
